Melinda Steffen I love the convenience of shopping without the crowds, comparing prices and free shipping without having to wait for a week for delivery. However I feel the prices have skyrocketed since the opening of the app. It used to be the cheapest prices I could find but now it's average and sometimes higher than going to your local target or Kohl's. Customer service has declined, getting someone on the phone to help you is near impossible, but I've never been disappointed when resolved.
