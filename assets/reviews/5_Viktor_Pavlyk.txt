I live abroad. More precisely, in Italy. I have been using it for several years. Satisfied. Twice there was an overlay with the product, but the money was still returned. In other cases, if I did not buy "that", then it is only because I did not carefully read about the product. And it often happened that the purchase arrived a day or two before the specified time. About the return of goods - I do not know how it is done. Just never tried.
