The app is still missing key features to make it more user friendly. Here are key needed improvements: search filters don’t work. The search function is really bad - I get all kinds of garbage. Need to add a way to exclude words. For ex searching for an iPhone case keeps showing me for the max model. Gave up and went somewhere else. The filters and sort choices aren’t followed. I’m searching for a desk with a specific width, I chose that and alll that I get is everything but that width. Why bother having a filter if it’s not usable? Or I put a price cap and filter by price and the results are in a random order and beyond the filters I’ve set. Understand if it’s one or two but 70% of results don’t fit the search terms and filters. Need to be able to filter for free shipping even if not prime. The search - need to have a way to go back to the search list, now i spent lots of time going down a search list then by mistake hit another “tab”at the bottom and my entire search list is gone. I lose where I was in my search, and need to start all over again. The typing/word processing is primitive - please add autocorrect or something like that - to type a review or ask a question on my phone takes 4 times longer than needed and I give up midway.
