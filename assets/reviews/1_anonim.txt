I dislike them, they’ve gotten worse, now our packages arrived not sealed at all which 9 times out of 10 means the order DOESNT ARRIVE then they want us to sent it back for a refund or replacement WHEN THERE IS NO ITEM. Its stupid! Because if you click the Missing/broken they ASSUME YOU HAVE IT EVEN THOUGH ITS MISSING. Theres no on site thing to review the company itself. Or file a complaint for its actual team. Then you spend an 1 hour on the phone with someone with an accent so thick you can’t understand them explaining you dont have the item! And it take them the entire hour to understand, for example, “i dont have the item i want a refund”

“You….dont have the item?” “No i dont have it” “ah well you can return it to get your refund” “I DONT HAVE IT” “Ohhhh!!! You dont have it, Let me see what i can do!” (30 minutes of waiting)

“Ah so it seems we can refund this but we can only do it to the site, maybbe the card” “i want the card refund. Its my money i need it” “Let me see what I can do…. you dont have the item???” “i dont have the item.” “Okay okay” (10 minutes) “you started the return process, yes? Can you return the item??“ “No.”(20 more minutes of basically explaining it in different words I NEVER received the item) “okay okay.. Ive started the return process your refund should be there in 5 days” “Thank you.”


THATS EVERYTIME IM ON CALL WITH THEM.
