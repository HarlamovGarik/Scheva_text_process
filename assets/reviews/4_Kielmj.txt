Since there is nowhere on the app to provide feedback on the interface, I guess I have to do it here, and I guess the first suggestion is for a place to ask questions and leave feedback about the interface.


Second item: put my friggin Lists back the way they were!! Why do you feel the need to screw up a perfectly good system?! What’s with the new icons and why are their two when they seem to do the same thing? I lost the functionality of being able to search my Lists for stuff. Very bad!! I now have you grouping things together for me - other than in my Lists… why??? That’s what the Lists are FOR aren’t they?? 🤦🏼‍♂️ Ugh, come on, guys! I get that you want to make things better, but where are you getting your intel from? Did I miss a survey? Did someone actually suggest jacking up the Lists and then not tell anybody - just sneak it in??


I love the app, love the services, love Prime (except for all the videos that do NOT come with my subscription… 🤬). But I reeeeally do not like you ruining Lists!!
