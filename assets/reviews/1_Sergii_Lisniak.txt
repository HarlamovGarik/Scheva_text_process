My first acquaintance with this platform turned out to be very negative. I ordered the goods, paid and am waiting for delivery, as indicated in the ad in 2-3 days. The status of the goods has not changed for 2 days. As reported by technical support - (separate conversation how they work) the warehouse will not be able to process parcels of this size... They advise to refuse the goods. For the sake of curiosity, I went to the page again and checked whether the lot I bought was removed from the list of available items - no, it is on sale. Who wants to ruin their plans - buy here
