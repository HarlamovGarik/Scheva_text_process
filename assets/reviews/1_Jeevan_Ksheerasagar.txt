Jeevan Ksheerasagar K Terrible Service – Unacceptable Delays and Lack of Flexibility I ordered an item with Amazon Prime, expecting the usual 2-day delivery. However, the item was delayed by 4 additional days, which made it useless for the intended purpose. To make matters worse, the item hadn't even shipped yet, and when I tried to cancel the order, Amazon wouldn’t let me! They effectively forced me to wait and charged me for an item I no longer needed. This experience was incredibly frustrating.
