The update was clearly designed for the iPhone. When using on an iPad, the proportions on the product pages now are very large and annoying. It’s hard to look at and I feel like I have to pull my iPad several feet away to see it. It’s just too large for a larger screen, especially in landscape mode. Under Subscriptions, there used to be small tabs across the top for Deliveries, Subscriptions, and Settings. Now with this update there is a large banner across the top that takes up 1/3 of the screen, making it more difficult to scroll and see what I want to see. Again appears to be designed solely for the iPhone. This is an old gripe but I’d thought I’d mention it since I’m in here: on the product pages there used to be a button to send someone a link to the product. This disappeared a while ago and it would be nice to have that back. Now if I want to show something to someone I need to take a screenshot and text it to them rather than a link. Pretty annoying. I understand many or most of your customers use a phone to view your site, but it would be nice if iPad users could have better functionality and not have the screen look so awkward now. Really disappointed.
