Terrapin Flyer Can. You. PLEASE. Implement more app control settings?? At least to disable video previews while browsing items, and to disable the View In Your Room function?? The app constantly crashes on me and I'm fairly certain these features could be causing it. Perhaps due to a memory leak or something. Regardless, they halt my progress in searching for and purchasing items having to wait 60 seconds for the third image and any consecutive images in a listing to load! It's been happening for over a year.
