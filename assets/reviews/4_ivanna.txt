I ordered the product on January 28, the next day I canceled it. After 2 days, the courier brought the goods. I told him that I would like to return this product. The courier noted something on his phone, took the goods and went back. The automatic cancellation did not go through. As a conclusion - I have neither the product nor the money for it. Please help me figure this out
