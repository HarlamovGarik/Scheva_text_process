Since the update, I get kicked off the app when I go to filters to pick specific sizes, colors, and materials and so on. It's VERY FRUSTRATING!I've always used filters to save time so I'm not scrolling through 1000 different products. Why is it crashing????? And yes, I have restarted my phone, uninstalled/reinstalled, and I have a lot of memory.
